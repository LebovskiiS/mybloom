### MyBloom

## Description
The essence of the project is to create the backend part of the application, 
through which customers will be able to buy space on a real farm 
and grow the fruits and vegetables they want. Everything will
happen in real time and the user will see the growing process
through animations. After that, they will get fresh produce
delivered straight from the vegetable garden.
