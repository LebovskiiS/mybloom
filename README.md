Welcome to the 'mybloom' project. The essence of the project is to create a 
back-end part of the application through which customers can buy their own 
space on a real farm and grow the vegetables and fruits they want. Everything 
will happen in real time, and the user will see the growing process with the 
help of animation. After that, they will receive the produce freshly 
delivered straight from the garden.

I am developing this project in Python using the asynchronous framework FastAPI,
PostgreSQL, and SQLAlchemy ORM. I also plan to use Redis and Kafka to 
eliminate performance bottlenecks.

Currently, I am developing this project on my own, 
introducing new features and updates every day.




You can see all the updates by downloading the repository and running the command:

    pip install -r requirements.txt
You can see how the API works by adding the /docs endpoint to the localhost.
